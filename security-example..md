### 1. Static Analysis

**Objective**: Identify potential vulnerabilities in the firmware source code.

**Tools**: 
- Pylint
- Bandit

**Steps**:
1. **Source Code Review**: Manually review the source code for common vulnerabilities.
2. **Automated Static Analysis**:
    - Use Pylint to check for coding standard violations.
    - Use Bandit to scan for security issues.

**Dockerfile for Static Analysis**:
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    clang \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip3 install pylint bandit

COPY ./firmware /app/firmware
WORKDIR /app/firmware

CMD ["sh", "-c", "pylint *.py && bandit -r ."]
```

---

### 2. Dynamic Analysis

**Objective**: Monitor the firmware's behavior during execution to detect anomalies.

**Tools**:
- Valgrind

**Steps**:
1. **Behavioral Analysis**: Execute the firmware in a controlled environment and monitor its behavior for any unusual activities.
2. **Fuzz Testing**: Input random or malformed data to identify potential crash points.

**Dockerfile for Dynamic Analysis**:
```Dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20.04

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
    build-essential \
    valgrind \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

COPY ./firmware /app/firmware
WORKDIR /app/firmware

CMD ["sh", "-c", "valgrind --leak-check=full ./firmware_test"]
```

---

### 3. Penetration Testing

**Objective**: Simulate attacks to identify security weaknesses.

**Steps**:
1. **Network Penetration Testing**: Simulate attacks on communication interfaces.
2. **Firmware Reversing**: Reverse engineer the firmware to identify hidden or undocumented features.
3. **Physical Security Testing**: Assess the physical security of the device.

**Example Penetration Test Script**:
```python
import subprocess

def simulate_network_attack(device_ip):
    attack_commands = [
        "nmap -sS -p 1-65535 " + device_ip,
        "metasploit -r exploit_script.rc"
    ]
    for command in attack_commands:
        subprocess.run(command, shell=True)

simulate_network_attack("192.168.1.100")
```

---

### 4. Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing

**Objective**: Test the firmware on the actual hardware to ensure real-world performance.

**Steps**:
1. **Setup HIL Environment**: Connect the device to a host machine using appropriate interfaces.
2. **Automate Test Execution**: Use scripts to load firmware, execute tests, and collect results.

**Example HIL Test Script**:
```python
import serial
import time

def flash_firmware(device, firmware_path):
    # Flash the firmware onto the device using a suitable tool
    pass

def run_tests(device):
    ser = serial.Serial(device, 115200, timeout=1)
    ser.write(b'run_tests\n')
    while True:
        line = ser.readline()
        if not line:
            break
        print(line.decode().strip())

def main():
    device = '/dev/ttyUSB0'
    firmware_path = 'path/to/firmware.bin'

    flash_firmware(device, firmware_path)
    time.sleep(2)  # Wait for the device to reboot
    run_tests(device)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline Integration

**Objective**: Automate the build, test, and deployment process using a CI/CD pipeline.

**CI/CD Configuration** (GitHub Actions Example):
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline for Pencil Master Digital E223345 2.0

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

      - name: Cache Docker layers
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: /tmp/.buildx-cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-${{ github.sha }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-buildx-

### 6. VirusTotal Integration

**Objective**: Scan the firmware binary for known malware signatures before deployment.

**Steps**:
1. **Upload Firmware to VirusTotal**: Use the VirusTotal API to upload the firmware binary.
2. **Analyze the Results**: Check the analysis results to ensure no malware is detected.
3. **Automate the Process**: Integrate this check into your CI/CD pipeline.

**Example Script to Upload Firmware to VirusTotal**:
```python
import requests
import time

API_KEY = 'your_virustotal_api_key'
FILE_PATH = 'path/to/firmware.bin'
URL = 'https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/file/scan'

def upload_to_virustotal(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        files = {'file': (file_path, file)}
        params = {'apikey': API_KEY}
        response = requests.post(URL, files=files, params=params)
        return response.json()

def get_analysis_report(resource):
    url = 'https://www.virustotal.com/vtapi/v2/file/report'
    params = {'apikey': API_KEY, 'resource': resource}
    response = requests.get(url, params=params)
    return response.json()

def main():
    response = upload_to_virustotal(FILE_PATH)
    resource = response['resource']

    # Wait for the analysis to complete
    time.sleep(60)

    report = get_analysis_report(resource)
    if report['response_code'] == 1 and report['positives'] == 0:
        print("No malware detected in the firmware.")
    else:
        print("Malware detected! Analysis report:")
        print(report)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```
