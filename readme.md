### TC048: Pencil Longevity Test

#### Objective:
Validate the longevity and consistent performance of the Pencil Master 2.0 over an extended period of use.

#### Steps:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Calibrate all measurement tools and testing equipment.
   - Prepare a controlled environment to simulate typical usage conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity).

2. **Baseline Measurement:**
   - Record initial measurements of the pencil's physical attributes (length, diameter, weight) and performance characteristics (writing smoothness, graphite flow consistency, darkness of mark).
   - Document the baseline data for future comparisons.

3. **Simulated Usage Procedure:**
   - Use a robotic arm or similar automated device to simulate writing with the pencil on standard paper types.
   - The simulation should mimic typical usage patterns, including varying pressure and writing styles.
   - Each writing session should last for a predefined duration (e.g., 30 minutes), followed by a short rest period to mimic actual use.
   - Repeat the writing simulation for a total of 1,000 hours or until the pencil is no longer usable.

4. **Periodic Measurements:**
   - At regular intervals (e.g., every 50 hours of simulated use), stop the test and measure the pencil's physical attributes and performance characteristics.
   - Compare the periodic measurements to the baseline data to identify any significant changes.

5. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect data on the pencil's physical degradation (e.g., reduction in length, changes in diameter, weight loss).
   - Record any changes in performance characteristics, such as writing smoothness, graphite flow consistency, and darkness of the mark.

6. **Analysis and Evaluation:**
   - Analyze the collected data to determine the pencil's wear rate and performance degradation over time.
   - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of each measured attribute at each interval.
   - Assess the pencil's ability to maintain its functionality and performance within acceptable limits throughout its expected lifespan.

#### Expected Result:
- The Pencil Master 2.0 should maintain its physical integrity and performance characteristics within acceptable limits for at least 1,000 hours of simulated use.
- The wear rate and performance degradation should be gradual and within the predefined acceptable range.

#### Example Calculations:
- **Wear Rate:**
  \[
  \text{Wear Rate} = \frac{\text{Initial Length} - \text{Final Length}}{\text{Total Hours of Use}}
  \]
  If the initial length is 7.5 inches and the final length after 1,000 hours is 6.5 inches, then:
  \[
  \text{Wear Rate} = \frac{7.5 - 6.5}{1000} = 0.001 \text{ inches per hour}
  \]
  Ensure the wear rate is within acceptable limits (e.g., ≤ 0.002 inches per hour).

- **Performance Degradation:**
  For a given attribute, suppose the initial darkness of the mark is 8.0 units and the final darkness after 1,000 hours is 7.5 units. Calculate the percentage degradation:
  \[
  \text{Percentage Degradation} = \left( \frac{8.0 - 7.5}{8.0} \right) \times 100 = 6.25\%
  \]
  Ensure the performance degradation is within acceptable limits (e.g., ≤ 10%).

#### Expected Result:
- The Pencil Master 2.0 should maintain consistent performance (writing smoothness, graphite flow consistency, and darkness of mark) across all tested paper types.
- Any performance variations should be within acceptable limits.

#### Example Calculations:
- **Writing Smoothness:**
  For each paper type, suppose the smoothness ratings are [8, 8.5, 9, 8.7, 8.8].
  \[
  \text{Mean Smoothness} = \frac{8 + 8.5 + 9 + 8.7 + 8.8}{5} = 8.6
  \]
  Ensure the mean smoothness rating is within acceptable limits (e.g., ≥ 8).

- **Graphite Flow Consistency:**
  For each paper type, suppose the consistency ratings are [9, 9.2, 9.1, 9.0, 9.3].
  \[
  \text{Mean Consistency} = \frac{9 + 9.2 + 9.1 + 9.0 + 9.3}{5} = 9.12
  \]
  Ensure the mean consistency rating is within acceptable limits (e.g., ≥ 9).

- Any performance variations should be within acceptable limits.

#### Example Calculations:
- **Writing Smoothness:**
  For each prosthetic device, suppose the smoothness ratings are [8, 8.5, 9, 8.7, 8.8].
  \[
  \text{Mean Smoothness} = \frac{8 + 8.5 + 9 + 8.7 + 8.8}{5} = 8.6
  \]
  Ensure the mean smoothness rating is within acceptable limits (e.g., ≥ 8).

- **Graphite Flow Consistency:**
